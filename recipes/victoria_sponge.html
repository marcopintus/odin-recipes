        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is the traditional recipe for a Victoria sponge cake, a much loved English favorite. Serve with buttercream as in the recipe, or freshly whipped cream. Dust with a layer of confectioners' sugar if desired.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/3 cups self-rising flour</li>
                <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>3/4 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/2 raspberry jam</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 7-inch cake pans and line with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Sift self-rising flour into a bowl; add sugar, margarine, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. Crack in eggs. Beat with a wooden spoon or an electric mixer until pale and fluffy. Divide batter between the cake pans; smooth the tops with the back of a spoon.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Sift confectioners' sugar into a bowl; add butter and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. Beat with an electric mixer until frosting is light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Spread raspberry jam over 1 cake layer. Cover jam with frosting. Place second cake layer on top.</li>
            </ol>
