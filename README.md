# odin-recipes

This is a beginner friendly html project from "Odin Project" that tests the basics of html. 
The aim was to create multiple pages containing different recipes where lists, paragraphs, headings, images and link constructs had to be employed. 

The web page will be improved via CSS further down the line. 

All the recipes are from https://www.allrecipes.com/
